Clone this repository as well as the [server app](https://github.com/wmyers/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample) for this example.

First, run the CORS enabled server app in port 3001. It only accepts client requests from http://localhost:8080

Then, run npm install on this project and run npm run watch to start the app. Then just navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
